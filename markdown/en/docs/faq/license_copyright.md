Q:
I’d like to use nginx distribution as part of my proprietary
software package. How can nginx copyright be acknowledged
when using nginx as part of a proprietary software distribution?


A:
The text below should be added to your license conditions,
followed by the text of the applicable 2-clause BSD license described
[here](http://nginx.org/LICENSE).


```
This product contains software provided by Nginx, Inc. and its contributors.
```

Also, if your build of nginx includes any of the following 3rd party
products: zlib, PCRE, OpenSSL — it’s worth including their
copyright acknowledgements and disclaimers as well.
