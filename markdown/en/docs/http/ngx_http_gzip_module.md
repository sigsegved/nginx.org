# Module ngx_http_gzip_module

**Revision:** 5  
**Language:** en

The `ngx_http_gzip_module` module is a filter that compresses responses using the “gzip” method. This often helps to reduce the size of transmitted data by half or even more.

> **Note:** When using the SSL/TLS protocol, compressed responses may be subject to [BREACH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BREACH) attacks.

# Example Configuration {#example}

```
gzip            on;
gzip_min_length 1000;
gzip_proxied    expired no-cache no-store private auth;
gzip_types      text/plain application/xml;
```

The `$gzip_ratio` variable can be used to log the achieved compression ratio.

# Directives {#directives}

## gzip

```
Syntax:  on | off
Default: off
Context: if in location, http, server, location
```

Enables or disables gzipping of responses.

## gzip_buffers

```
Syntax:  number size
Default: 32 4k|16 8k
Context: location, http, server
```

Sets the `number` and `size` of buffers used to compress a response. By default, the buffer size is equal to one memory page. This is either 4K or 8K, depending on a platform.

> **Note:** Until version 0.7.28, four 4K or 8K buffers were used by default.

## gzip_comp_level

```
Syntax:  level
Default: 1
Context: location, http, server
```

Sets a gzip compression `level` of a response. Acceptable values are in the range from 1 to 9.

## gzip_disable

```
Syntax:  regex ...
Default: 
Context: location, http, server
```

*This directive appeared in version 0.6.23.*

Disables gzipping of responses for requests with `User-Agent` header fields matching any of the specified regular expressions.

The special mask “ `msie6` ” (0.7.12) corresponds to the regular expression “ `MSIE [4-6]\.` ”, but works faster. Starting from version 0.8.11, “ `MSIE 6.0; ... SV1` ” is excluded from this mask.

## gzip_http_version

```
Syntax:  1.0 | 1.1
Default: 1.1
Context: location, http, server
```

Sets the minimum HTTP version of a request required to compress a response.

## gzip_min_length

```
Syntax:  length
Default: 20
Context: location, http, server
```

Sets the minimum length of a response that will be gzipped. The length is determined only from the `Content-Length` response header field.

## gzip_proxied

```
Syntax:  off | expired | no-cache | no-store | private | no_last_modified | no_etag | auth | any ...
Default: off
Context: location, http, server
```

Enables or disables gzipping of responses for proxied requests depending on the request and response. The fact that the request is proxied is determined by the presence of the `Via` request header field. The directive accepts multiple parameters:

**`off`**  
  disables compression for all proxied requests,
ignoring other parameters;

**`expired`**  
  enables compression if a response header includes the `Expires` field with a value that disables caching;

**`no-cache`**  
  enables compression if a response header includes the `Cache-Control` field with the
“ `no-cache` ” parameter;

**`no-store`**  
  enables compression if a response header includes the `Cache-Control` field with the
“ `no-store` ” parameter;

**`private`**  
  enables compression if a response header includes the `Cache-Control` field with the
“ `private` ” parameter;

**`no_last_modified`**  
  enables compression if a response header does not include the `Last-Modified` field;

**`no_etag`**  
  enables compression if a response header does not include the `ETag` field;

**`auth`**  
  enables compression if a request header includes the `Authorization` field;

**`any`**  
  enables compression for all proxied requests.

## gzip_types

```
Syntax:  mime-type ...
Default: text/html
Context: location, http, server
```

Enables gzipping of responses for the specified MIME types in addition to “ `text/html` ”. The special value “ `*` ” matches any MIME type (0.8.29). Responses with the “ `text/html` ” type are always compressed.

## gzip_vary

```
Syntax:  on | off
Default: off
Context: location, http, server
```

Enables or disables inserting the `Vary: Accept-Encoding` response header field if the directives [gzip](#gzip) , [gzip_static](ngx_http_gzip_static_module.xml#gzip_static) , or [gunzip](ngx_http_gunzip_module.xml#gunzip) are active.

# Embedded Variables {#variables}

**`$gzip_ratio`**  
  achieved compression ratio, computed as the ratio between the
original and compressed response sizes.
