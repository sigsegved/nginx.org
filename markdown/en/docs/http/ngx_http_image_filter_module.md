# Module ngx_http_image_filter_module

**Revision:** 4  
**Language:** en


The `ngx_http_image_filter_module` module (0.7.54+) is a filter
that transforms images in JPEG, GIF, PNG, and WebP formats.

This module is not built by default, it should be enabled with the
`--with-http_image_filter_module`
configuration parameter.

> **Note:** This module utilizes the
[libgd](http://libgd.org) library.
It is recommended to use the latest available version of the library.


> **Note:** The WebP format support appeared in version 1.11.6.
To transform images in this format,
the `libgd` library must be compiled with the WebP support.

## Example Configuration {#example}

```
location /img/ {
    proxy_pass   http://backend;
    image_filter resize 150 100;
    image_filter rotate 90;
    error_page   415 = /empty;
}

location = /empty {
    empty_gif;
}
```

location


Sets the type of transformation to perform on images:


off

turns off module processing in a surrounding location.


test

ensures that responses are images in either JPEG, GIF, PNG, or WebP format.
Otherwise, the

error is returned.


size

outputs information about images in a JSON format, e.g.:

{ "img" : { "width": 100, "height": 100, "type": "gif" } }

In case of an error, the output is as follows:

{}



rotate
90|180|270


rotates images counter-clockwise by the specified number of degrees.
Parameter value can contain variables.
This mode can be used either alone or along with the
resize and crop transformations.


resize
width
height


proportionally reduces an image to the specified sizes.
To reduce by only one dimension, another dimension can be specified as
“-”.
In case of an error, the server will return code
.
Parameter values can contain variables.
When used along with the rotate parameter,
the rotation happens after reduction.


crop
width
height


proportionally reduces an image to the larger side size
and crops extraneous edges by another side.
To reduce by only one dimension, another dimension can be specified as
“-”.
In case of an error, the server will return code
.
Parameter values can contain variables.
When used along with the rotate parameter,
the rotation happens before reduction.







size
1M
http
server
location


Sets the maximum size of the buffer used for reading images.
When the size is exceeded the server returns error
.

1.3.15


If enabled, final images will be interlaced.
For JPEG, final images will be in “progressive JPEG” format.




quality
75
http
server
location


Sets the desired quality of the transformed JPEG images.
Acceptable values are in the range from 1 to 100.
Lesser values usually imply both lower image quality and less data to transfer.
The maximum recommended value is 95.
Parameter value can contain variables.




percent
0
http
server
location


Increases sharpness of the final image.
The sharpness percentage can exceed 100.
The zero value disables sharpening.
Parameter value can contain variables.




on|off
on
http
server
location


Defines whether transparency should be preserved when transforming
GIF images or PNG images with colors specified by a palette.
The loss of transparency results in images of a better quality.
The alpha channel transparency in PNG is always preserved.




quality
80
http
server
location
1.11.6


Sets the desired quality of the transformed WebP images.
Acceptable values are in the range from 1 to 100.
Lesser values usually imply both lower image quality and less data to transfer.
Parameter value can contain variables.
