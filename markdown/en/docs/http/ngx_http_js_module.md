# Module ngx_http_js_module

**Revision:** 57  
**Language:** en


The `ngx_http_js_module` module is used to implement
location and variable handlers
in [njs](../njs/index.html) —
a subset of the JavaScript language.

Download and install instructions are available
[here](../njs/install.html).

## Example Configuration {#example}

The example works since
[0.4.0](../njs/changes.xml#njs0.4.0).

```
http {
    js_import http.js;

    js_set $foo     http.foo;
    js_set $summary http.summary;
    js_set $hash    http.hash;

    resolver 10.0.0.1;

    server {
        listen 8000;

        location / {
            add_header X-Foo $foo;
            js_content http.baz;
        }

        location = /summary {
            return 200 $summary;
        }

        location = /hello {
            js_content http.hello;
        }

        # since 0.7.0
        location = /fetch {
            js_content                   http.fetch;
            js_fetch_trusted_certificate /path/to/ISRG_Root_X1.pem;
        }

        # since 0.7.0
        location = /crypto {
            add_header Hash $hash;
            return     200;
        }
    }
}
```

The `http.js` file:

```
function foo(r) {
    r.log("hello from foo() handler");
    return "foo";
}

function summary(r) {
    var a, s, h;

    s = "JS summary\n\n";

    s += "Method: " + r.method + "\n";
    s += "HTTP version: " + r.httpVersion + "\n";
    s += "Host: " + r.headersIn.host + "\n";
    s += "Remote Address: " + r.remoteAddress + "\n";
    s += "URI: " + r.uri + "\n";

    s += "Headers:\n";
    for (h in r.headersIn) {
        s += "  header '" + h + "' is '" + r.headersIn[h] + "'\n";
    }

    s += "Args:\n";
    for (a in r.args) {
        s += "  arg '" + a + "' is '" + r.args[a] + "'\n";
    }

    return s;
}

function baz(r) {
    r.status = 200;
    r.headersOut.foo = 1234;
    r.headersOut['Content-Type'] = "text/plain; charset=utf-8";
    r.headersOut['Content-Length'] = 15;
    r.sendHeader();
    r.send("nginx");
    r.send("java");
    r.send("script");

    r.finish();
}

function hello(r) {
    r.return(200, "Hello world!");
}

// since 0.7.0
async function fetch(r) {
    let results = await Promise.all([ngx.fetch('https://nginx.org/'),
                                     ngx.fetch('https://nginx.org/en/')]);

    r.return(200, JSON.stringify(results, undefined, 4));
}

// since 0.7.0
async function hash(r) {
    let hash = await crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-512', r.headersIn.host);
    r.setReturnValue(Buffer.from(hash).toString('hex'));
}

export default {foo, summary, baz, hello, fetch, hash};
```

## Directives {#directives}


module.function
[buffer_type=string | buffer]

location
if in location
limit_except
0.5.2


Sets an njs function as a response body filter.
The filter function is called for each data chunk of a response body
with the following arguments:


r

the HTTP request object


data

the incoming data chunk,
may be a string or Buffer
depending on the buffer_type value,
by default is a string.
Since 0.8.5, the
data value is implicitly converted to a valid UTF-8 string
by default.
For binary data, the buffer_type value
should be set to buffer.


flags

an object with the following properties:

last

a boolean value, true if data is a last buffer.









The filter function can pass its own modified version
of the input data chunk to the next body filter by calling
r.sendBuffer().
For example, to transform all the lowercase letters in the response body:

function filter(r, data, flags) {
    r.sendBuffer(data.toLowerCase(), flags);
}




If the filter function changes the length of the response body, the
Content-Length response header (if present) should be cleared
in js_header_filter
to enforce chunked transfer encoding:

example.conf:
 location /foo {
     # proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;

    js_header_filter main.clear_content_length;
    js_body_filter   main.filter;
 }

example.js:
 function clear_content_length(r) {
     delete r.headersOut['Content-Length'];
 }




To stop filtering and pass the data chunks to the client
without calling js_body_filter,
r.done()
can be used.
For example, to prepend some data to the response body:

function prepend(r, data, flags) {
    r.sendBuffer("XXX");
    r.sendBuffer(data, flags);
    r.done();
}





As the js_body_filter handler
returns its result immediately, it supports
only synchronous operations.
Thus, asynchronous operations such as
r.subrequest()
or
setTimeout()
are not supported.





The directive can be specified inside the
if block
since 0.7.7.





module.function

location
if in location
limit_except


Sets an njs function as a location content handler.
Since 0.4.0,
a module function can be referenced.




The directive can be specified inside the
if block
since 0.7.7.





number
128
http
server
location
0.8.6


Sets a maximum number of JS context to be reused for
QuickJS engine.
Each context is used for a single request.
The finished context is put into a pool of reusable contexts.
If the pool is full, the context is destroyed.




njs | qjs
njs
http
server
location
0.8.6


Sets a JavaScript engine
to be used for njs scripts.
The njs parameter sets the njs engine, also used by default.
The qjs parameter sets the QuickJS engine.




size
16k
http
server
location
0.7.4


Sets the size of the buffer used for reading and writing
with Fetch API.




ciphers
HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5
http
server
location
0.7.0


Specifies the enabled ciphers for HTTPS requests
with Fetch API.
The ciphers are specified in the format understood by the
OpenSSL library.



The full list can be viewed using the
“openssl ciphers” command.




size
1m
http
server
location
0.7.4


Sets the maximum size of the response received
with Fetch API.





    [TLSv1]
    [TLSv1.1]
    [TLSv1.2]
    [TLSv1.3]
TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2
http
server
location
0.7.0


Enables the specified protocols for HTTPS requests
with Fetch API.




time
60s
http
server
location
0.7.4


Defines a timeout for reading and writing
for Fetch API.
The timeout is set only between two successive read/write operations,
not for the whole response.
If no data is transmitted within this time, the connection is closed.




file

http
server
location
0.7.0


Specifies a file with trusted CA certificates in the PEM format
used to
verify
the HTTPS certificate
with Fetch API.




on | off
on
http
server
location
0.7.4


Enables or disables verification of the HTTPS server certificate
with Fetch API.




number
100
http
server
location
0.7.0


Sets the verification depth in the HTTPS server certificates chain
with Fetch API.




url

http
server
location
0.9.4


Configures a forward proxy URL
with Fetch API.
The url supports the HTTP scheme only
and can contain optional user credentials
in the format http://[user:password@]host:port
for Basic authentication.
Supports both HTTP and HTTPS connections to destination servers.
If the url is empty, proxy routing is disabled.
The parameter value can contain variables.



Example:

location /fetch {
    js_fetch_proxy http://user:pass@proxy.example.com:3128;
    js_content main.fetch_handler;
}





connections
0
http
server
location
0.9.2


Activates the cache for connections to destination servers.
When the value is greater than 0,
enables keepalive connections for
Fetch API.



The connections parameter sets the maximum number of idle
keepalive connections to destination servers that are preserved in the cache
of each worker process.
When this number is exceeded, the least recently used connections are closed.



Example:

location /fetch {
    js_fetch_keepalive 32;
    js_fetch_trusted_certificate /path/to/ISRG_Root_X1.pem;
    js_content main.fetch_handler;
}





number
1000
http
server
location
0.9.2


Sets the maximum number of requests that can be served through one keepalive
connection with Fetch API.
After the maximum number of requests is made, the connection is closed.



Closing connections periodically is necessary to free per-connection memory
allocations.
Therefore, using too high maximum number of requests could result in
excessive memory usage and not recommended.




time
1h
http
server
location
0.9.2


Limits the maximum time during which requests can be processed through one
keepalive connection with Fetch API.
After this time is reached, the connection is closed following the subsequent
request processing.




time
60s
http
server
location
0.9.2


Sets a timeout during which an idle keepalive connection to a destination server
will stay open with Fetch API.




module.function

location
if in location
limit_except
0.5.1


Sets an njs function as a response header filter.
The directive allows changing arbitrary header fields of a response header.




As the js_header_filter handler
returns its result immediately, it supports
only synchronous operations.
Thus, asynchronous operations such as
r.subrequest()
or
setTimeout()
are not supported.





The directive can be specified inside the
if block
since 0.7.7.





module.js |
export_name from module.js

http
server
location
0.4.0


Imports a module that implements location and variable handlers in njs.
The export_name is used as a namespace
to access module functions.
If the export_name is not specified,
the module name will be used as a namespace.

js_import http.js;

Here, the module name http is used as a namespace
while accessing exports.
If the imported module exports foo(),
http.foo is used to refer to it.



Several js_import directives can be specified.




The directive can be specified on the
server and location level
since 0.7.7.





file

http


Specifies a file that implements location and variable handlers in njs:

nginx.conf:
js_include http.js;
location   /version {
    js_content version;
}

http.js:
function version(r) {
    r.return(200, njs.version);
}




The directive was made obsolete in version
0.4.0
and was removed in version
0.7.1.
The  directive should be used instead.





path

http
server
location
0.3.0


Sets an additional path for njs modules.




The directive can be specified on the
server and location level
since 0.7.7.





module.function
        [interval=time]
        [jitter=number]
        [worker_affinity=mask]

location
0.8.1


Specifies a content handler to run at regular interval.
The handler receives a
session object
as its first argument,
it also has access to global objects such as
ngx.



The optional interval parameter
sets the interval between two consecutive runs,
by default, 5 seconds.



The optional jitter parameter sets the time within which
the location content handler will be randomly delayed,
by default, there is no delay.



By default, the js_handler is executed on worker process 0.
The optional worker_affinity parameter
allows specifying particular worker processes
where the location content handler should be executed.
Each worker process set is represented by a bitmask of allowed worker processes.
The all mask allows the handler to be executed
in all worker processes.



Example:

example.conf:

location @periodics {
    # to be run at 1 minute intervals in worker process 0
    js_periodic main.handler interval=60s;

    # to be run at 1 minute intervals in all worker processes
    js_periodic main.handler interval=60s worker_affinity=all;

    # to be run at 1 minute intervals in worker processes 1 and 3
    js_periodic main.handler interval=60s worker_affinity=0101;

    resolver 10.0.0.1;
    js_fetch_trusted_certificate /path/to/ISRG_Root_X1.pem;
}

example.js:

async function handler(s) {
    let reply = await ngx.fetch('https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/');
    let body = await reply.text();

    ngx.log(ngx.INFO, body);
}





name.json |
name from file.json

http
server
location
0.7.8


Preloads an
immutable object
at configure time.
The name is used as a name of the global variable
though which the object is available in njs code.
If the name is not specified,
the file name will be used instead.

js_preload_object map.json;

Here, the map is used as a name
while accessing the preloaded object.



Several js_preload_object directives can be specified.





    $variable
    module.function
    [nocache]

http
server
location


Sets an njs function
for the specified variable.
Since 0.4.0,
a module function can be referenced.



The function is called when
the variable is referenced for the first time for a given request.
The exact moment depends on a
phase
at which the variable is referenced.
This can be used to perform some logic
not related to variable evaluation.
For example, if the variable is referenced only in the
 directive,
its handler will not be executed until the log phase.
This handler can be used to do some cleanup
right before the request is freed.



Since 0.8.6,
if an optional argument nocache is specified,
the handler is called every time it is referenced.
Due to current limitations
of the rewrite module,
when a nocache variable is referenced by the
set directive
its handler should always return a fixed-length value.




As the js_set handler
returns its result immediately, it supports
only synchronous operations.
Thus, asynchronous operations such as
r.subrequest()
or
setTimeout()
are not supported.





The directive can be specified on the
server and location level
since 0.7.7.






    zone=name:size
    [timeout=time]
    [type=string|number]
    [evict]
    [state=file]

http
0.8.0


Sets the name and size of the shared memory zone
that keeps the
key-value dictionary
shared between worker processes.



By default the shared dictionary uses a string as a key and a value.
The optional type parameter
allows redefining the value type to number.



The optional timeout parameter sets
the time in milliseconds
after which all shared dictionary entries are removed from the zone.
If some entries require a different removal time, it can be set
with the timeout argument of the
add,
incr, and
set
methods
(0.8.5).



The optional evict parameter removes the oldest
key-value pair when the zone storage is exhausted.



The optional state parameter specifies a file
that keeps the shared dictionary state
in JSON format and makes it persistent across nginx restarts
(0.9.1).



Example:

example.conf:
    # Creates a 1Mb dictionary with string values,
    # removes key-value pairs after 60 seconds of inactivity:
    js_shared_dict_zone zone=foo:1M timeout=60s;

    # Creates a 512Kb dictionary with string values,
    # forcibly removes oldest key-value pairs when the zone is exhausted:
    js_shared_dict_zone zone=bar:512K timeout=30s evict;

    # Creates a 32Kb permanent dictionary with number values:
    js_shared_dict_zone zone=num:32k type=number;

    # Creates a 1Mb dictionary with string values and persistent state:
    js_shared_dict_zone zone=persistent:1M state=/tmp/dict.json;

example.js:
    function get(r) {
        r.return(200, ngx.shared.foo.get(r.args.key));
    }

    function set(r) {
        r.return(200, ngx.shared.foo.set(r.args.key, r.args.value));
    }

    function del(r) {
        r.return(200, ngx.shared.bar.delete(r.args.key));
    }

    function increment(r) {
        r.return(200, ngx.shared.num.incr(r.args.key, 2));
    }





$variable [value]

http
server
location
0.5.3


Declares
a writable
variable.
The value can contain text, variables, and their combination.
The variable is not overwritten after a redirect
unlike variables created with the
 directive.




The directive can be specified on the
server and location level
since 0.7.7.




## Request Argument {#arguments}

Each HTTP njs handler receives one argument, a request
[object](../njs/reference.xml#http).
