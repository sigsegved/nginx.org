# Module ngx_http_limit_conn_module

**Revision:** 14  
**Language:** en

The `ngx_http_limit_conn_module` module is used to limit the number of connections per the defined key, in particular, the number of connections from a single IP address.

Not all connections are counted. A connection is counted only if it has a request being processed by the server and the whole request header has already been read.

# Example Configuration {#example}

```
http {
    limit_conn_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=addr:10m;

    ...

    server {

        ...

        location /download/ {
            limit_conn addr 1;
        }
```

# Directives {#directives}

## limit_conn

```
Syntax:  zone number
Default: 
Context: location, http, server
```

Sets the shared memory zone and the maximum allowed number of connections for a given key value. When this limit is exceeded, the server will return the [error](#limit_conn_status) in reply to a request. For example, the directives

```
limit_conn_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=addr:10m;

server {
    location /download/ {
        limit_conn addr 1;
    }
```

allow only one connection per an IP address at a time.

> **Note:** In HTTP/2 and HTTP/3,
each concurrent request is considered a separate connection.

There could be several `limit_conn` directives. For example, the following configuration will limit the number of connections to the server per a client IP and, at the same time, the total number of connections to the virtual server:

```
limit_conn_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=perip:10m;
limit_conn_zone $server_name zone=perserver:10m;

server {
    ...
    limit_conn perip 10;
    limit_conn perserver 100;
}
```

These directives are inherited from the previous configuration level if and only if there are no `limit_conn` directives defined on the current level.

## limit_conn_dry_run

```
Syntax:  on | off
Default: off
Context: location, http, server
```

*This directive appeared in version 1.17.6.*

Enables the dry run mode. In this mode, the number of connections is not limited, however, in the shared memory zone, the number of excessive connections is accounted as usual.

## limit_conn_log_level

```
Syntax:  info | notice | warn | error
Default: error
Context: location, http, server
```

*This directive appeared in version 0.8.18.*

Sets the desired logging level for cases when the server limits the number of connections.

## limit_conn_status

```
Syntax:  code
Default: 503
Context: location, http, server
```

*This directive appeared in version 1.3.15.*

Sets the status code to return in response to rejected requests.

## limit_conn_zone

```
Syntax:  key zone=name:size
Default: 
Context: http
```

Sets parameters for a shared memory zone that will keep states for various keys. In particular, the state includes the current number of connections. The `key` can contain text, variables, and their combination. Requests with an empty key value are not accounted.

> **Note:** Prior to version 1.7.6, a `key` could contain exactly one variable.

Usage example:

```
limit_conn_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=addr:10m;
```

Here, a client IP address serves as a key. Note that instead of `$remote_addr` , the `$binary_remote_addr` variable is used here. The `$remote_addr` variable’s size can vary from 7 to 15 bytes. The stored state occupies either 32 or 64 bytes of memory on 32-bit platforms and always 64 bytes on 64-bit platforms. The `$binary_remote_addr` variable’s size is always 4 bytes for IPv4 addresses or 16 bytes for IPv6 addresses. The stored state always occupies 32 or 64 bytes on 32-bit platforms and 64 bytes on 64-bit platforms. One megabyte zone can keep about 32 thousand 32-byte states or about 16 thousand 64-byte states. If the zone storage is exhausted, the server will return the [error](#limit_conn_status) to all further requests.

> **Note:** Additionally, as part of our [commercial subscription](https://nginx.com/products/) ,
the [status information](ngx_http_api_module.xml#http_limit_conns_) for each such shared memory zone can be [obtained](ngx_http_api_module.xml#getHttpLimitConnZone) or [reset](ngx_http_api_module.xml#deleteHttpLimitConnZoneStat) with the [API](ngx_http_api_module.xml) since 1.17.7.

## limit_zone

```
Syntax:  name $variable size
Default: 
Context: http
```

This directive was made obsolete in version 1.1.8 and was removed in version 1.7.6. An equivalent [limit_conn_zone](#limit_conn_zone) directive with a changed syntax should be used instead:

> **Note:** `limit_conn_zone` `$variable` `zone` = `name` : `size` ;

# Embedded Variables {#variables}

**`$limit_conn_status`**  
  keeps the result of limiting the number of connections (1.17.6): `PASSED` , `REJECTED` , or `REJECTED_DRY_RUN`
