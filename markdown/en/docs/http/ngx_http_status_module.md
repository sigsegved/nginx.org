# Module ngx_http_status_module

**Revision:** 19  
**Language:** en

The `ngx_http_status_module` module provides access to various status information.

> **Note:** This module was available as part of our [commercial subscription](https://nginx.com/products/) until 1.13.10.
It was superseded by the [ngx_http_api_module](ngx_http_api_module.xml) module
in 1.13.3.

# Example Configuration {#example}

```
http {
    upstream backend {
        zone http_backend 64k;

        server backend1.example.com weight=5;
        server backend2.example.com;
    }

    proxy_cache_path /data/nginx/cache_backend keys_zone=cache_backend:10m;

    server {
        server_name backend.example.com;

        location / {
            proxy_pass  http://backend;
            proxy_cache cache_backend;

            health_check;
        }

        status_zone server_backend;
    }

    server {
        listen 127.0.0.1;

        location /upstream_conf {
            upstream_conf;
        }

        location /status {
            status;
        }

        location = /status.html {
        }
    }
}

stream {
    upstream backend {
        zone stream_backend 64k;

        server backend1.example.com:12345 weight=5;
        server backend2.example.com:12345;
    }

    server {
        listen      127.0.0.1:12345;
        proxy_pass  backend;
        status_zone server_backend;
        health_check;
    }
}
```

Examples of status requests with this configuration:

```
http://127.0.0.1/status
http://127.0.0.1/status/nginx_version
http://127.0.0.1/status/caches/cache_backend
http://127.0.0.1/status/upstreams
http://127.0.0.1/status/upstreams/backend
http://127.0.0.1/status/upstreams/backend/peers/1
http://127.0.0.1/status/upstreams/backend/peers/1/weight
http://127.0.0.1/status/stream
http://127.0.0.1/status/stream/upstreams
http://127.0.0.1/status/stream/upstreams/backend
http://127.0.0.1/status/stream/upstreams/backend/peers/1
http://127.0.0.1/status/stream/upstreams/backend/peers/1/weight
```

The simple monitoring page is shipped with this distribution, accessible as “ `/status.html` ” in the default configuration. It requires the locations “ `/status` ” and “ `/status.html` ” to be configured as shown above.

# Directives {#directives}

## status

```
Syntax:  
Default: 
Context: location
```

The status information will be accessible from the surrounding location. Access to this location should be [limited](ngx_http_core_module.xml#satisfy) .

## status_format

```
Syntax:  jsonp [callback]
Default: json
Context: location, http, server
```

By default, status information is output in the JSON format.

Alternatively, data may be output as JSONP. The `callback` parameter specifies the name of a callback function. Parameter value can contain variables. If parameter is omitted, or the computed value is an empty string, then “ `ngx_status_jsonp_callback` ” is used.

## status_zone

```
Syntax:  zone
Default: 
Context: server
```

Enables collection of virtual [http](ngx_http_core_module.xml#server) or [stream](../stream/ngx_stream_core_module.xml#server) (1.7.11) server status information in the specified `zone` . Several servers may share the same zone.
