# Module ngx_http_stub_status_module

**Revision:** 4  
**Language:** en


The `ngx_http_stub_status_module` module provides
access to basic status information.

This module is not built by default, it should be enabled with the
`--with-http_stub_status_module`
configuration parameter.

## Example Configuration {#example}

```
location = /basic_status {
    stub_status;
}
```

This configuration creates a simple web page
with basic status data which may look like as follows:

```
Active connections: 291
server accepts handled requests
 16630948 16630948 31070465
Reading: 6 Writing: 179 Waiting: 106
```

## Directives {#directives}




server
location


The basic status information will be accessible from the surrounding location.




In versions prior to 1.7.5,
the directive syntax required an arbitrary argument, for example,
“stub_status on”.




## Data {#data}

The following status information is provided:

**`Active connections`**  
  The current number of active client connections
including `Waiting` connections.
**`accepts`**  
  The total number of accepted client connections.
**`handled`**  
  The total number of handled connections.
Generally, the parameter value is the same as `accepts`
unless some resource limits have been reached
(for example, the
[](../ngx_core_module.xml#worker_connections) limit).
**`requests`**  
  The total number of client requests.
**`Reading`**  
  The current number of connections where nginx is reading the request header.
**`Writing`**  
  The current number of connections
where nginx is writing the response back to the client.
**`Waiting`**  
  The current number of idle client connections waiting for a request.

## Embedded Variables {#variables}

The `ngx_http_stub_status_module` module
supports the following embedded variables (1.3.14):

***$connections_active***  
  same as the `Active connections` value;
***$connections_reading***
