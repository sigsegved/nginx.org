# Module ngx_http_sub_module

**Revision:** 6  
**Language:** en

The `ngx_http_sub_module` module is a filter that modifies a response by replacing one specified string by another.

This module is not built by default, it should be enabled with the `--with-http_sub_module` configuration parameter.

# Example Configuration {#example}

```
location / {
    sub_filter '<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8080/'  '<a href="https://$host/';
    sub_filter '<img src="http://127.0.0.1:8080/' '<img src="https://$host/';
    sub_filter_once on;
}
```

# Directives {#directives}

## sub_filter

```
Syntax:  sub_filter string replacement;
Default: 
Context: location, http, server
```

Sets a string to replace and a replacement string. The string to replace is matched ignoring the case. The string to replace (1.9.4) and replacement string can contain variables. Several `sub_filter` directives can be specified on the same configuration level (1.9.4). These directives are inherited from the previous configuration level if and only if there are no `sub_filter` directives defined on the current level.

## sub_filter_last_modified

```
Syntax:  sub_filter_last_modified on | off;
Default: off
Context: location, http, server
```

*This directive appeared in version 1.5.1.*

Allows preserving the `Last-Modified` header field from the original response during replacement to facilitate response caching.

By default, the header field is removed as contents of the response are modified during processing.

## sub_filter_once

```
Syntax:  sub_filter_once on | off;
Default: on
Context: location, http, server
```

Indicates whether to look for each string to replace once or repeatedly.

## sub_filter_types

```
Syntax:  sub_filter_types mime-type ...;
Default: text/html
Context: location, http, server
```

Enables string replacement in responses with the specified MIME types in addition to “ `text/html` ”. The special value “ `*` ” matches any MIME type (0.8.29).
