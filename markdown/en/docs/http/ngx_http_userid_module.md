# Module ngx_http_userid_module

**Revision:** 5  
**Language:** en

The `ngx_http_userid_module` module sets cookies suitable for client identification. Received and set cookies can be logged using the embedded variables [$uid_got](#var_uid_got) and [$uid_set](#var_uid_set) . This module is compatible with the [mod_uid](http://www.lexa.ru/programs/mod-uid-eng.html) module for Apache.

# Example Configuration {#example}

```
userid         on;
userid_name    uid;
userid_domain  example.com;
userid_path    /;
userid_expires 365d;
userid_p3p     'policyref="/w3c/p3p.xml", CP="CUR ADM OUR NOR STA NID"';
```

# Directives {#directives}

## userid

```
Syntax:  userid on | v1 | log | off;
Default: off
Context: location, http, server
```

Enables or disables setting cookies and logging the received cookies:

**`on`**  
  enables the setting of version 2 cookies
and logging of the received cookies;

**`v1`**  
  enables the setting of version 1 cookies
and logging of the received cookies;

**`log`**  
  disables the setting of cookies,
but enables logging of the received cookies;

**`off`**  
  disables the setting of cookies and logging of the received cookies.

## userid_domain

```
Syntax:  userid_domain name | none;
Default: none
Context: location, http, server
```

Defines a domain for which the cookie is set. The `none` parameter disables setting of a domain for the cookie.

## userid_expires

```
Syntax:  userid_expires time | max | off;
Default: off
Context: location, http, server
```

Sets a time during which a browser should keep the cookie. The parameter `max` will cause the cookie to expire on “ `31 Dec 2037 23:55:55 GMT` ”. The parameter `off` will cause the cookie to expire at the end of a browser session.

## userid_flags

```
Syntax:  userid_flags off | flag ...;
Default: off
Context: location, http, server
```

*This directive appeared in version 1.19.3.*

If the parameter is not `off` , defines one or more additional flags for the cookie: `secure` , `httponly` , `samesite=strict` , `samesite=lax` , `samesite=none` .

## userid_mark

```
Syntax:  userid_mark letter | digit | = | off;
Default: off
Context: location, http, server
```

If the parameter is not `off` , enables the cookie marking mechanism and sets the character used as a mark. This mechanism is used to add or change [userid_p3p](#userid_p3p) and/or a cookie expiration time while preserving the client identifier. A mark can be any letter of the English alphabet (case-sensitive), digit, or the “ `=` ” character.

If the mark is set, it is compared with the first padding symbol in the base64 representation of the client identifier passed in a cookie. If they do not match, the cookie is resent with the specified mark, expiration time, and `P3P` header.

## userid_name

```
Syntax:  userid_name name;
Default: uid
Context: location, http, server
```

Sets the cookie name.

## userid_p3p

```
Syntax:  userid_p3p string | none;
Default: none
Context: location, http, server
```

Sets a value for the `P3P` header field that will be sent along with the cookie. If the directive is set to the special value `none` , the `P3P` header will not be sent in a response.

## userid_path

```
Syntax:  userid_path path;
Default: /
Context: location, http, server
```

Defines a path for which the cookie is set.

## userid_service

```
Syntax:  userid_service number;
Default: IP address of the server
Context: location, http, server
```

If identifiers are issued by multiple servers (services), each service should be assigned its own `number` to ensure that client identifiers are unique. For version 1 cookies, the default value is zero. For version 2 cookies, the default value is the number composed from the last four octets of the server’s IP address.

# Embedded Variables {#variables}

The `ngx_http_userid_module` module supports the following embedded variables:

**`$uid_got`**  
  The cookie name and received client identifier.

**`$uid_reset`**  
  If the variable is set to a non-empty string that is not “ `0` ”,
the client identifiers are reset.
The special value “ `log` ” additionally leads to the output of
messages about the reset identifiers to the [error_log](../ngx_core_module.xml#error_log) .

**`$uid_set`**  
  The cookie name and sent client identifier.
