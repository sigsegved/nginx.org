# Module ngx_http_v2_module

**Revision:** 19  
**Language:** en

The `ngx_http_v2_module` module (1.9.5) provides support for [HTTP/2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7540) .

This module is not built by default, it should be enabled with the `--with-http_v2_module` configuration parameter.

# Known Issues {#issues}

Before version 1.9.14, buffering of a client request body could not be disabled regardless of [proxy_request_buffering](ngx_http_proxy_module.xml#proxy_request_buffering) , [fastcgi_request_buffering](ngx_http_fastcgi_module.xml#fastcgi_request_buffering) , [uwsgi_request_buffering](ngx_http_uwsgi_module.xml#uwsgi_request_buffering) , and [scgi_request_buffering](ngx_http_scgi_module.xml#scgi_request_buffering) directive values.

Before version 1.19.1, the [lingering_close](ngx_http_core_module.xml#lingering_close) mechanism was not used to control closing HTTP/2 connections.

# Example Configuration {#example}

```
server {
    listen 443 ssl;

    http2 on;

    ssl_certificate server.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key server.key;
}
```

Note that accepting HTTP/2 connections over TLS requires the “Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation” (ALPN) TLS extension support, which is available since [OpenSSL](http://www.openssl.org) version 1.0.2.

Also note that if the [ssl_prefer_server_ciphers](ngx_http_ssl_module.xml#ssl_prefer_server_ciphers) directive is set to the value “ `on` ”, the [ciphers](ngx_http_ssl_module.xml#ssl_ciphers) should be configured to comply with [RFC 9113, Appendix A](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9113#appendix-A) black list and supported by clients.

# Directives {#directives}

## http2

```
Syntax:  http2 on | off;
Default: off
Context: server, http
```

*This directive appeared in version 1.25.1.*

Enables the [HTTP/2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9113) protocol.

## http2_body_preread_size

```
Syntax:  http2_body_preread_size size;
Default: 64k
Context: server, http
```

*This directive appeared in version 1.11.0.*

Sets the `size` of the buffer per each request in which the request body may be saved before it is started to be processed.

## http2_chunk_size

```
Syntax:  http2_chunk_size size;
Default: 8k
Context: location, http, server
```

Sets the maximum size of chunks into which the response body is sliced. A too low value results in higher overhead. A too high value impairs prioritization due to [HOL blocking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-of-line_blocking) .

## http2_idle_timeout

```
Syntax:  http2_idle_timeout time;
Default: 3m
Context: server, http
```

> **Note:** This directive is obsolete since version 1.19.7.
The [keepalive_timeout](ngx_http_core_module.xml#keepalive_timeout) directive should be used instead.

Sets the timeout of inactivity after which the connection is closed.

## http2_max_concurrent_pushes

```
Syntax:  http2_max_concurrent_pushes number;
Default: 10
Context: server, http
```

*This directive appeared in version 1.13.9.*

> **Note:** This directive is obsolete since version 1.25.1.

Limits the maximum number of concurrent [push](#http2_push) requests in a connection.

## http2_max_concurrent_streams

```
Syntax:  http2_max_concurrent_streams number;
Default: 128
Context: server, http
```

Sets the maximum number of concurrent HTTP/2 streams in a connection.

## http2_max_field_size

```
Syntax:  http2_max_field_size size;
Default: 4k
Context: server, http
```

> **Note:** This directive is obsolete since version 1.19.7.
The [large_client_header_buffers](ngx_http_core_module.xml#large_client_header_buffers) directive should be used instead.

Limits the maximum size of an [HPACK](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7541) -compressed request header field. The limit applies equally to both name and value. Note that if Huffman encoding is applied, the actual size of decompressed name and value strings may be larger. For most requests, the default limit should be enough.

## http2_max_header_size

```
Syntax:  http2_max_header_size size;
Default: 16k
Context: server, http
```

> **Note:** This directive is obsolete since version 1.19.7.
The [large_client_header_buffers](ngx_http_core_module.xml#large_client_header_buffers) directive should be used instead.

Limits the maximum size of the entire request header list after [HPACK](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7541) decompression. For most requests, the default limit should be enough.

## http2_max_requests

```
Syntax:  http2_max_requests number;
Default: 1000
Context: server, http
```

*This directive appeared in version 1.11.6.*

> **Note:** This directive is obsolete since version 1.19.7.
The [keepalive_requests](ngx_http_core_module.xml#keepalive_requests) directive should be used instead.

Sets the maximum number of requests (including [push](#http2_push) requests) that can be served through one HTTP/2 connection, after which the next client request will lead to connection closing and the need of establishing a new connection.

Closing connections periodically is necessary to free per-connection memory allocations. Therefore, using too high maximum number of requests could result in excessive memory usage and not recommended.

## http2_push

```
Syntax:  http2_push uri | off;
Default: off
Context: location, http, server
```

*This directive appeared in version 1.13.9.*

> **Note:** This directive is obsolete since version 1.25.1.
The [early_hints](ngx_http_core_module.xml#early_hints) directive can be used instead.

Pre-emptively sends ( [pushes](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9113#section-8.4) ) a request to the specified `uri` along with the response to the original request. Only relative URIs with absolute path will be processed, for example:

```
http2_push /static/css/main.css;
```

The `uri` value can contain variables.

Several `http2_push` directives can be specified on the same configuration level. The `off` parameter cancels the effect of the `http2_push` directives inherited from the previous configuration level.

## http2_push_preload

```
Syntax:  http2_push_preload on | off;
Default: off
Context: location, http, server
```

*This directive appeared in version 1.13.9.*

> **Note:** This directive is obsolete since version 1.25.1.

Enables automatic conversion of [preload links](https://www.w3.org/TR/preload/#server-push-http-2) specified in the `Link` response header fields into [push](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9113#section-8.4) requests.

## http2_recv_buffer_size

```
Syntax:  http2_recv_buffer_size size;
Default: 256k
Context: http
```

Sets the size of the per [worker](../ngx_core_module.xml#worker_processes) input buffer.

## http2_recv_timeout

```
Syntax:  http2_recv_timeout time;
Default: 30s
Context: server, http
```

> **Note:** This directive is obsolete since version 1.19.7.
The [client_header_timeout](ngx_http_core_module.xml#client_header_timeout) directive should be used instead.

Sets the timeout for expecting more data from the client, after which the connection is closed.

# Embedded Variables {#variables}

The `ngx_http_v2_module` module supports the following embedded variables:

**`$http2`**  
  negotiated protocol identifier:
“ `h2` ” for HTTP/2 over TLS,
“ `h2c` ” for HTTP/2 over cleartext TCP,
or an empty string otherwise.
