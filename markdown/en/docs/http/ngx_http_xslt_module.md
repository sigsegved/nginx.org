# Module ngx_http_xslt_module

**Revision:** 3  
**Language:** en

The `ngx_http_xslt_module` (0.7.8+) is a filter that transforms XML responses using one or more XSLT stylesheets.

This module is not built by default, it should be enabled with the `--with-http_xslt_module` configuration parameter.

> **Note:** This module requires the [libxml2](http://xmlsoft.org) and [libxslt](http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/) libraries.

# Example Configuration {#example}

```
location / {
    xml_entities    /site/dtd/entities.dtd;
    xslt_stylesheet /site/xslt/one.xslt param=value;
    xslt_stylesheet /site/xslt/two.xslt;
}
```

# Directives {#directives}

## xml_entities

```
Syntax:  xml_entities path;
Default: 
Context: location, http, server
```

Specifies the DTD file that declares character entities. This file is compiled at the configuration stage. For technical reasons, the module is unable to use the external subset declared in the processed XML, so it is ignored and a specially defined file is used instead. This file should not describe the XML structure. It is enough to declare just the required character entities, for example:

```
<!ENTITY nbsp "&#xa0;">
```

## xslt_last_modified

```
Syntax:  xslt_last_modified on | off;
Default: off
Context: location, http, server
```

*This directive appeared in version 1.5.1.*

Allows preserving the `Last-Modified` header field from the original response during XSLT transformations to facilitate response caching.

By default, the header field is removed as contents of the response are modified during transformations and may contain dynamically generated elements or parts that are changed independently of the original response.

## xslt_param

```
Syntax:  xslt_param parameter value;
Default: 
Context: location, http, server
```

*This directive appeared in version 1.1.18.*

Defines the parameters for XSLT stylesheets. The `value` is treated as an XPath expression. The `value` can contain variables. To pass a string value to a stylesheet, the [xslt_string_param](#xslt_string_param) directive can be used.

There could be several `xslt_param` directives. These directives are inherited from the previous configuration level if and only if there are no `xslt_param` and [xslt_string_param](#xslt_string_param) directives defined on the current level.

## xslt_string_param

```
Syntax:  xslt_string_param parameter value;
Default: 
Context: location, http, server
```

*This directive appeared in version 1.1.18.*

Defines the string parameters for XSLT stylesheets. XPath expressions in the `value` are not interpreted. The `value` can contain variables.

There could be several `xslt_string_param` directives. These directives are inherited from the previous configuration level if and only if there are no [xslt_param](#xslt_param) and `xslt_string_param` directives defined on the current level.

## xslt_stylesheet

```
Syntax:  xslt_stylesheet stylesheet [parameter=value ...];
Default: 
Context: location
```

Defines the XSLT stylesheet and its optional parameters. A stylesheet is compiled at the configuration stage.

Parameters can either be specified separately, or grouped in a single line using the “ `:` ” delimiter. If a parameter includes the “ `:` ” character, it should be escaped as “ `%3A` ”. Also, `libxslt` requires to enclose parameters that contain non-alphanumeric characters into single or double quotes, for example:

```
param1='http%3A//www.example.com':param2=value2
```

The parameters description can contain variables, for example, the whole line of parameters can be taken from a single variable:

```
location / {
    xslt_stylesheet /site/xslt/one.xslt
                    $arg_xslt_params
                    param1='$value1':param2=value2
                    param3=value3;
}
```

It is possible to specify several stylesheets. They will be applied sequentially in the specified order.

## xslt_types

```
Syntax:  xslt_types mime-type ...;
Default: text/xml
Context: location, http, server
```

Enables transformations in responses with the specified MIME types in addition to “ `text/xml` ”. The special value “ `*` ” matches any MIME type (0.8.29). If the transformation result is an HTML response, its MIME type is changed to “ `text/html` ”.
