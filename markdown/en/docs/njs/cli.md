# Command-line interface

**Revision:** 4  
**Language:** en


njs scripts development and debugging can be performed
from the command-line.
The command-line utility is available after the installation of
the Linux [package](install.xml#install_package)
or after building from the
[sources](install.xml#install_sources).
Compared to njs running inside nginx,
nginx objects
([HTTP](reference.xml#http) and
[Stream](reference.xml#stream))
are not available in the utility.

```
$ echo "2**3" | njs -q
