## nginx objects {#http_stream}

### HTTP Request {#http}

| r.args{} |
| --- |
| r.done() |
| r.error() |
| r.finish() |
| r.headersIn{} |
| r.headersOut{} |
| r.httpVersion |
| r.internal |
| r.internalRedirect() |
| r.log() |
| r.method |
| r.parent |
| r.remoteAddress |
| r.requestBody |
| r.requestBuffer |
| r.requestText |
| r.rawHeadersIn[] |
| r.rawHeadersOut[] |
| r.responseBody |
| r.responseBuffer |
| r.responseText |
| r.return() |
| r.send() |
| r.sendBuffer() |
| r.sendHeader() |
| r.setReturnValue() |
| r.status |
| r.subrequest() |
| r.uri |
| r.rawVariables{} |
| r.variables{} |
| r.warn() |

The HTTP request object is available only in the
[ngx_http_js_module](../http/ngx_http_js_module.html) module.
Before [0.8.5](changes.xml#njs0.8.5),
all string properties of the object
were byte strings.


**`r.args{}`**  
  request arguments object, read-only.

The query string is returned as an object.
Since 0.7.6,
duplicate keys are returned as an array,
keys are case-sensitive, both keys and values are percent-decoded.



For example, the query string

'a=1&b=%32&A=3&b=4&B=two%20words'

is converted to r.args as:

{a: "1", b: ["2", "4"], A: "3", B: "two words"}

More advanced parsing scenarios can be achieved with the
Query String module
and with the
$args
variable, for example:


import qs from 'querystring';

function args(r) {
    return qs.parse(r.variables.args);
}

The argument object
is evaluated at the first access to r.args.
If only a single argument is needed, for example foo,
nginx variables can be used:

r.variables.arg_foo

Here, nginx variables object
returns the first value for a given key,
case-insensitive, without percent-decoding.



To convert r.args back to a string,
the Query String
stringify
method can be used.
**`r.done()`**  
  after calling this function,
next data chunks will be passed to client without calling
[](../http/ngx_http_js_module.xml#js_body_filter)
([0.5.2](changes.xml#njs0.5.2)).
May be called only from the
[](../http/ngx_http_js_module.xml#js_body_filter) function
**`r.error(string)`**  
  writes a `string` to the error log
on the `error` level of logging


As nginx has a
hardcoded
maximum line length limit,
only first 2048 bytes of the string can be logged.
**`r.finish()`**  
  finishes sending a response to the client
**`r.headersIn{}`**  
  incoming headers object, read-only.

The Foo request header
can be accessed with the syntax:
headersIn.foo or headersIn['Foo'].



The
Authorization,
Content-Length,
Content-Range,
Content-Type,
ETag,
Expect,
From,
Host,
If-Match,
If-Modified-Since,
If-None-Match,
If-Range,
If-Unmodified-Since,
Max-Forwards,
Proxy-Authorization,
Referer,
Transfer-Encoding, and
User-Agent
request headers can have only one field value
(0.4.1).
Duplicate field values in Cookie headers
are separated by semicolon (;).
Duplicate field values in all other request headers are separated by commas.
**`r.headersOut{}`**  
  outgoing headers object for the main request, writable.


If r.headersOut{} is the response object of
a subrequest, it represents response headers.
In this case, field values in
Accept-Ranges,
Connection,
Content-Disposition,
Content-Encoding,
Content-Length,
Content-Range,
Date,
Keep-Alive,
Server,
Transfer-Encoding,
X-Accel-*
response headers may be omitted.



The Foo response header
can be accessed with the syntax:
headersOut.foo or headersOut['Foo'].



Outgoing headers should be set before a response header is sent to a client,
otherwise header update will be ignored.
This means that r.headersOut{} is effectively writable in:




the  handler before
r.sendHeader() or
r.return() are called



the  handler






Field values of multi-value response headers
(0.4.0)
can be set with the syntax:

r.headersOut['Foo'] = ['a', 'b']

where the output will be:

Foo: a
Foo: b

All previous field values of the Foo response header
will be deleted.



For standard response headers
that accept only a single field value such as
Content-Type,
only the last element of the array will take effect.
Field values of the Set-Cookie response header
are always returned as an array.
Duplicate field values in
Age,
Content-Encoding,
Content-Length,
Content-Type,
ETag,
Expires,
Last-Modified,
Location,
Retry-After
response headers are ignored.
Duplicate field values in all other response headers
are separated by commas.
**`r.httpVersion`**  
  HTTP version, read-only
**`r.internal`**  
  boolean value, true for
[internal](../http/ngx_http_core_module.xml#internal)
locations
**`r.internalRedirect(uri)`**  
  performs an
[internal
redirect](../dev/development_guide.xml#http_request_redirection)
to the specified `uri`.
If the uri starts with the “`@`” prefix,
it is considered a named location.
In a new location, all request processing is repeated
starting from [NGX_HTTP_SERVER_REWRITE_PHASE](../dev/development_guide.xml#http_phases)
for ordinary locations and from [NGX_HTTP_REWRITE_PHASE](../dev/development_guide.xml#http_phases)
for named locations.
As a result, a redirect to a named location
does not check [](../http/ngx_http_core_module.xml#client_max_body_size)
limit.
See [dev guide](../dev/development_guide.xml#http_request_redirection)
for more details.
Redirected requests become internal and can access the
[internal](../http/ngx_http_core_module.xml#internal)
locations.
The actual redirect happens after the handler execution is completed.


After redirect,
a new njs VM is started in the target location,
the VM in the original location is stopped.
Values of nginx variables are kept
and can be used to pass information to the target location.
Since 0.5.3,
the variable declared with the js_var directive for
http or
stream
can be used.





Since 0.7.4,
the method accepts escaped URIs.
**`r.log(string)`**  
  writes a `string` to the error log
on the `info` level of logging


As nginx has a
hardcoded
maximum line length limit,
only first 2048 bytes of the string can be logged.
**`r.method`**  
  HTTP method, read-only
**`r.parent`**  
  references the parent request object
**`r.remoteAddress`**  
  client address, read-only
**`r.requestBody`**  
  the property was made obsolete in
[0.5.0](changes.xml#njs0.5.0)
and was removed in [0.8.0](changes.xml#njs0.8.0).
The r.requestBuffer or
r.requestText property
should be used instead.
**`r.requestBuffer`**  
  client request body if it has not been written to a temporary file
(since [0.5.0](changes.xml#njs0.5.0)).
To ensure that the client request body is in memory,
its size should be limited by
[](../http/ngx_http_core_module.xml#client_max_body_size),
and a sufficient buffer size should be set using
[](../http/ngx_http_core_module.xml#client_body_buffer_size).
The property is available only in the
[](../http/ngx_http_js_module.xml#js_content) directive.
**`r.requestText`**  
  the same as r.requestBuffer,
but returns a `string`.
Note that
it may convert bytes invalid in UTF-8 encoding into the replacement character.
**`r.rawHeadersIn[]`**  
  returns an array of key-value pairs
exactly as they were received from the client
([0.4.1](changes.xml#njs0.4.1)).

For example, with the following request headers:

Host: localhost
Foo:  bar
foo:  bar2

the output of r.rawHeadersIn will be:

[
    ['Host', 'localhost'],
    ['Foo', 'bar'],
    ['foo', 'bar2']
]

All foo headers
can be collected with the syntax:

r.rawHeadersIn.filter(v=>v[0].toLowerCase() == 'foo').map(v=>v[1])

the output will be:

['bar', 'bar2']

Header field names are not converted to lower case,
duplicate field values are not merged.
**`r.rawHeadersOut[]`**  
  returns an array of key-value pairs of response headers
([0.4.1](changes.xml#njs0.4.1)).
Header field names are not converted to lower case,
duplicate field values are not merged.
**`r.responseBody`**  
  the property was made obsolete in
[0.5.0](changes.xml#njs0.5.0)
and was removed in [0.8.0](changes.xml#njs0.8.0).
The r.responseBuffer
or
the r.responseText
property
should be used instead.
**`r.responseBuffer`**  
  holds the subrequest response body,
read-only
(since [0.5.0](changes.xml#njs0.5.0)).
The size of `r.responseBuffer` is limited by the
[](../http/ngx_http_core_module.xml#subrequest_output_buffer_size)
directive.
**`r.responseText`**  
  the same as r.responseBuffer
but returns a string
(since [0.5.0](changes.xml#njs0.5.0)).
Note that
it may convert bytes invalid in UTF-8 encoding into the replacement character.
**`r.return(status[,
string | Buffer])`**  
  sends the entire response
with the specified `status` to the client.
The response can be a string or Buffer
([0.5.0](changes.xml#njs0.5.0)).

It is possible to specify either a redirect URL
(for codes 301, 302, 303, 307, and 308)
or the response body text (for other codes) as the second argument
**`r.send(string
| Buffer)`**  
  sends a part of the response body to the client.
The data sent can be a string or Buffer
([0.5.0](changes.xml#njs0.5.0))
**`r.sendBuffer(data[,
options])`**  
  adds data to the chain of data chunks to be forwarded to the next body filter
([0.5.2](changes.xml#njs0.5.2)).
The actual forwarding happens later,
when the all the data chunks of the current chain are processed.

The data can be a string or Buffer.
The options is an object used
to override nginx buffer flags derived from an incoming data chunk buffer.
The flags can be overridden with the following flags:


last

boolean,
true if the buffer is the last buffer


flush

boolean,
true if the buffer should have the flush flag



The method may be called only from the
[](../http/ngx_http_js_module.xml#js_body_filter) function.
**`r.sendHeader()`**  
  sends the HTTP headers to the client
**`r.setReturnValue(value)`**  
  sets the return value of the
[](../http/ngx_http_js_module.xml#js_set) handler
([0.7.0](changes.xml#njs0.7.0)).
Unlike an ordinary return statement,
this method should be used when the handler is JS async function.
For example:

```
async function js_set(r) {
    const digest = await crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', r.headersIn.host);
    r.setReturnValue(digest);
}
```
**`r.status`**  
  status, writable
**`r.subrequest(uri[,
options[, callback]])`**  
  creates a subrequest with the given `uri` and
`options`, and installs
an optional completion `callback`.


A
subrequest
shares its input headers with the client request.
To send headers different from original headers to a proxied server, the

directive can be used.
To send a completely new set of headers to a proxied server, the

directive can be used.



If options is a string, then it
holds the subrequest arguments string.
Otherwise, options is expected to be
an object with the following keys:

args

arguments string, by default an empty string is used

body

request body,
by default the request body of the parent request object is used


method

HTTP method, by default the GET method is used


detached

boolean flag (0.3.9),
if true, the created subrequest is a detached subrequest.
Responses to detached subrequests are ignored.
Unlike ordinary subrequests, a detached subrequest
can be created inside a variable handler.
The detached flag and callback argument
are mutually exclusive.






The completion callback receives
a subrequest response object with methods and properties
identical to the parent request object.



Since 0.3.8,
if a callback is not provided,
the Promise object
that resolves to the subrequest response object
is returned.



For example, to view all response headers in the subrequest:

async function handler(r) {
    const reply = await r.subrequest('/path');

    for (const h in reply.headersOut) {
        r.log(`${h}: ${reply.headersOut[h]}`);
    }

    r.return(200);
}
**`r.uri`**  
  current [URI](../http/ngx_http_core_module.xml#var_uri)
in request,
[normalized](../http/ngx_http_core_module.xml#location),
read-only
**`r.rawVariables{}`**  
  nginx variables as Buffers,
writable
(since [0.5.0](changes.xml#njs0.5.0))
**`r.variables{}`**  
  [nginx variables](../varindex.html) object, writable
(since [0.2.8](changes.xml#njs0.2.8)).


For example, to get the $foo variable,
one of the following syntax can be used:

r.variables['foo']
r.variables.foo

Since 0.8.6,
regular expression captures can be accessed using the following syntax:

r.variables['1']
r.variables[1]




nginx treats variables referenced in nginx.conf
and unreferenced variables differently.
When a variable is referenced, it may be cacheable,
but when it is unreferenced it is always uncacheable.
For example, when the
$request_id
variable is only accessed from njs,
it has a new value every time it is evaluated.
But, when the
$request_id
is referenced, for example:

proxy_set_header X-Request-Id $request_id;

the r.variables.request_id returns the same value every time.



A variable is writable if:



it was created using the js_var directive for
http or
stream
(since 0.5.3)



it is referenced in nginx configuration file



Even so, some embedded variables still cannot be assigned a value (for example,
$http_).
**`r.warn(string)`**  
  writes a `string` to the error log
on the `warning` level of logging


As nginx has a
hardcoded
maximum line length limit,
only first 2048 bytes of the string can be logged.

### Stream Session {#stream}

| s.allow() |
| --- |
| s.decline() |
| s.deny() |
| s.done() |
| s.error() |
| s.log() |
| s.off() |
| s.on() |
| s.remoteAddress |
| s.rawVariables{} |
| s.send() |
| s.sendDownstream() |
| s.sendUpstream() |
| s.status |
| s.setReturnValue() |
| s.variables{} |
| s.warn() |

The stream session object is available only in the
[ngx_stream_js_module](../stream/ngx_stream_js_module.html)
module.
Before [0.8.5](changes.xml#njs0.8.5),
all string properties of the object
were byte strings.

**`s.allow()`**  
  an alias to
s.done(0)
([0.2.4](changes.xml#njs0.2.4))
**`s.decline()`**  
  an alias to
s.done(-5)
([0.2.4](changes.xml#njs0.2.4))
**`s.deny()`**  
  an alias to
s.done(403)
([0.2.4](changes.xml#njs0.2.4))
**`s.done([code]`)**  
  sets an exit `code` for the current
[phase](../stream/stream_processing.html) handler
to a code value, by default `0`.
The actual finalization happens when the js handler is completed
and all pending events, for example, from
ngx.fetch() or
setTimeout(),
are processed
([0.2.4](changes.xml#njs0.2.4)).

Possible code values:



0—
successful finalization, passing control to the next phase



-5—
undecided, passing control to the next handler of the current phase (if any)



403—
access is forbidden




May be called only from a phase handler function:
[js_access](../stream/ngx_stream_js_module.xml#js_access)
or
[js_preread](../stream/ngx_stream_js_module.xml#js_preread).
**`s.error(string)`**  
  writes a sent `string` to the error log
on the `error` level of logging


As nginx has a
hardcoded
maximum line length limit,
only first 2048 bytes of the string can be logged.
**`s.log(string)`**  
  writes a sent *string* to the error log
on the `info` level of logging


As nginx has a
hardcoded
maximum line length limit,
only first 2048 bytes of the string can be logged.
**`s.off(eventName)`**  
  unregisters the callback set by the s.on() method
([0.2.4](changes.xml#njs0.2.4))
**`s.on(event,
callback)`**  
  registers a `callback`
for the specified `event`
([0.2.4](changes.xml#njs0.2.4)).


An event may be one of the following strings:

upload

new data (string) from a client


download

new data (string) to a client


upstream

new data (Buffer) from a client
(since 0.5.0)


downstream

new data (Buffer) to a client
(since 0.5.0)






The completion callback has the following prototype:
callback(data, flags), where
data is string or Buffer (depending on the event type)
flags is an object
with the following properties:

last

a boolean value, true if data is a last buffer.
**`s.remoteAddress`**  
  client address, read-only
**`s.rawVariables`**  
  nginx variables as Buffers,
writable
(since [0.5.0](changes.xml#njs0.5.0))
**`s.send(data[,
options])`**  
  adds data to the chain of data chunks that will be forwarded in
the forward direction:
in download callback to a client; in upload to an upstream server
([0.2.4](changes.xml#njs0.2.4)).
The actual forwarding happens later,
when the all the data chunks of the current chain are processed.

The data can be a string or Buffer
(0.5.0).
The options is an object used
to override nginx buffer flags derived from an incoming data chunk buffer.
The flags can be overridden with the following flags:


last

boolean,
true if the buffer is the last buffer


flush

boolean,
true if the buffer should have the flush flag



The method can be called multiple times per callback invocation.
**`s.sendDownstream()`**  
  is identical to s.send(),
except for it always sends data to a client
(since [0.7.8](changes.xml#njs0.7.8)).
**`s.sendUpstream()`**  
  is identical to s.send(),
except for it always sends data from a client
(since [0.7.8](changes.xml#njs0.7.8)).
**`s.status`**  
  session status code, an alias to the
[$status](../stream/ngx_stream_core_module.xml#var_status)
variable,
read only
(since [0.5.2](changes.xml#njs0.5.2))
**`s.setReturnValue(value)`**  
  sets the return value of the
[](../stream/ngx_stream_js_module.xml#js_set) handler
([0.7.0](changes.xml#njs0.7.0)).
Unlike an ordinary return statement,
this method should be used when the handler is JS async function.
For example:

```
async function js_set(r) {
    const digest = await crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', r.headersIn.host);
    r.setReturnValue(digest);
}
```
**`s.variables{}`**  
  [nginx variables](../varindex.html) object, writable
(since [0.2.8](changes.xml#njs0.2.8)).
A variable can be writable only
if it is referenced in nginx configuration file.
Even so, some embedded variables still cannot be assigned a value.
**`s.warn(string)`**  
  writes a sent `string` to the error log
on the `warning` level of logging


As nginx has a
hardcoded
maximum line length limit,
only first 2048 bytes of the string can be logged.

### String {#string}

By default all strings in njs are Unicode strings.
They correspond to ECMAScript strings that contain Unicode characters.
Before [0.8.0](changes.xml#njs0.8.0),
byte strings were also supported.

#### Byte strings {#byte_string}

> **Note:** Since [0.8.0](changes.xml#njs0.8.0),
the support for byte strings and byte string methods were removed.
When working with byte sequence,
the Buffer object
and `Buffer` properties, such as
r.requestBuffer,
r.rawVariables,
should be used.

Byte strings contain a sequence of bytes
and are used to serialize Unicode strings
to external data and deserialize from external sources.
For example, the toUTF8() method serializes
a Unicode string to a byte string using UTF-8 encoding:

```
>> '£'.toUTF8().toString('hex')
'c2a3'  /* C2 A3 is the UTF-8 representation of 00A3 ('£') code point */
```

The toBytes() method serializes
a Unicode string with code points up to 255 into a byte string,
otherwise, `null` is returned:

```
>> '£'.toBytes().toString('hex')
'a3'  /* a3 is a byte equal to 00A3 ('£') code point  */
```



**`String.bytesFrom(array
| string, encoding)`**  
  The method was made obsolete in
[0.4.4](changes.xml#njs0.4.4)
and was removed in [0.8.0](changes.xml#njs0.8.0).
The `Buffer.from` method should be used instead:

```
>> Buffer.from([0x62, 0x75, 0x66, 0x66, 0x65, 0x72]).toString()
'buffer'

>> Buffer.from('YnVmZmVy', 'base64').toString()
'buffer'
```

Before [0.4.4](changes.xml#njs0.4.4),
created a byte string either from an array that contained octets,
or from an encoded string
([0.2.3](changes.xml#njs0.2.3)),
the encoding could be
`hex`,
`base64`, and
`base64url`.
**`String.prototype.fromBytes(start[,
end])`**  
  the property was made obsolete in
[0.7.7](changes.xml#njs0.7.7)
and was removed in [0.8.0](changes.xml#njs0.8.0).
Before [0.7.7](changes.xml#njs0.7.7),
returned a new Unicode string from a byte string
where each byte was replaced with a corresponding Unicode code point.
**`String.prototype.fromUTF8(start[,
end])`**  
  the property was made obsolete in
[0.7.7](changes.xml#njs0.7.7)
and was removed in [0.8.0](changes.xml#njs0.8.0).
The TextDecoder method
should be used instead.
Before [0.7.7](changes.xml#njs0.7.7),
converted a byte string containing a valid UTF-8 string
into a Unicode string,
otherwise `null` was returned.
**`String.prototype.toBytes(start[,
end])`**  
  the property was made obsolete in
[0.7.7](changes.xml#njs0.7.7)
and was removed in [0.8.0](changes.xml#njs0.8.0).
Before [0.7.7](changes.xml#njs0.7.7),
serialized a Unicode string to a byte string,
returned `null` if a character larger than 255 was
found in the string.
**`String.prototype.toString(encoding)`**  
  the property was made obsolete in
0.7.7
and was removed in 0.8.0.
Before 0.7.7,
encoded a string to
hex,
base64, or
base64url:

>>  'αβγδ'.toString('base64url')
'zrHOss6zzrQ'

Before version 0.4.3,
only a byte string could be encoded:

>>  'αβγδ'.toUTF8().toString('base64url')
'zrHOss6zzrQ'
**`String.prototype.toUTF8(start[,
end])`**  
  the property was made obsolete in
[0.7.7](changes.xml#njs0.7.7)
and was removed in [0.8.0](changes.xml#njs0.8.0).
The TextEncoder method
should be used instead.
Before [0.7.7](changes.xml#njs0.7.7),
serialized a Unicode string
to a byte string using UTF-8 encoding:

```
>> 'αβγδ'.toUTF8().length
8
>> 'αβγδ'.length
4
```

for specified `encoding`,
currently, only UTF-8 is supported.
The `options` is
`TextDecoderOptions` dictionary with the property:

  Returns a string with the name of the encoding used by
TextDecoder(),
read-only.
**`TextDecoder.prototype.fatal`**  
  boolean flag, `true` if
the error mode is fatal,
read-only.

additional data will follow in subsequent calls to `decode()`:
`true` if processing the data in chunks, and
`false` for the final chunk
or if the data is not chunked.
By default is `false`.

returns a dictionary object that shows the progress of the encoding.
The dictionary object contains two members:


**`read`**  
  the number of UTF-16 units of code from the source `string`
converted to UTF-8
**`written`**  
  the number of bytes modified in the destination `Uint8Array`

  Decodes a string of data which has been encoded
using `Base64` encoding.
The `encodedData` parameter is a binary string
that contains Base64-encoded data.
Returns a string that contains decoded data from `encodedData`.

The similar btoa() method
can be used to encode and transmit data
which may otherwise cause communication problems,
then transmit it and use the atob() method
to decode the data again.
For example, you can encode, transmit, and decode control characters
such as ASCII values 0 through 31.

const encodedData = btoa("text to encode"); // encode a string
const decodedData = atob(encodedData); // decode the string
**`btoa(stringToEncode)`**  
  Creates a Base64-encoded ASCII string from a binary string.
The `stringToEncode` parameter is a binary string to encode.
Returns an ASCII string containing the Base64 representation of
`stringToEncode`.

The method can be used to encode data
which may otherwise cause communication problems, transmit it,
then use the atob() method
to decode the data again.
For example, you can encode control characters
such as ASCII values 0 through 31.

const encodedData = btoa("text to encode"); // encode a string
const decodedData = atob(encodedData); // decode the string

#### fs.FileHandle {#fs_filehandle}

| filehandle.close() |
| --- |
| filehandle.fd |
| filehandle.read() |
| filehandle.stat() |
| filehandle.write(buf) |
| filehandle.write(str) |

The `FileHandle` object is an object wrapper
for a numeric file descriptor
([0.7.7](changes.xml#njs0.7.7)).
Instances of the `FileHandle` object are created by the
fs.promises.open() method.
If a `FileHandle` is not closed using the
filehandle.close() method,
it will try to automatically close the file descriptor,
helping to prevent memory leaks.
Please do not rely on this behavior because it can be unreliable.
Instead, always explicitly close a `FileHandle`.

**`filehandle.close()`**  
  Closes the file handle after waiting for any pending operation on the handle
to complete.
Returns a `promise`, fulfills with undefined upon success.
**`filehandle.fd`**  
  The numeric file descriptor
managed by the `FileHandle` object.
**`filehandle.read(buffer,
offset[,
length[,
position]])`**  
  Reads data from the file and stores that in the given buffer.


**`buffer`**  
  a buffer that will be filled with the file data read,
the value can be a
`Buffer`,
`TypedArray`, or
`DataView`
**`offset`**  
  is an `integer`
representing the location in the buffer at which to start filling
**`length`**  
  is an `integer`
representing the number of bytes to read
**`position`**  
  the location where to begin reading data from the file,
the value can be
`integer`,
`null`.
If `null`, data will be read from the current file position
and the position will be updated.
If position is an `integer`,
the current file position will remain unchanged.


Returns a `Promise` which fulfills upon success
with an object with two properties:

**`bytesRead`**  
  is an `integer` representing the number of bytes read
**`buffer`**  
  is a reference to the passed argument in buffer, can be
`Buffer`,
`TypedArray`, or
`DataView`
**`filehandle.stat()`**  
  Fulfills with an
fs.Stats for the file,
returns a `promise`.
**`filehandle.write(buffer,
offset[,
length[,
position]])`**  
  Writes a buffer to the file.


**`buffer`**  
  the `buffer` value can be a
`Buffer`,
`TypedArray`, or
`DataView`
**`offset`**  
  is an `integer` representing
the start position from within buffer where the data to write begins
**`length`**  
  is an `integer` representing
the number of bytes from buffer to write, by default
is an offset of
Buffer.byteLength
**`position`**  
  the offset from the beginning of the file
where the data from buffer should be written,
can be an
`integer` or
`null`,
by default is `null`.
If `position` is not a `number`,
the data will be written at the current position.
See the POSIX
[pwrite(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html)
documentation for details.

Returns a `Promise` which is resolved with an object
containing two properties:

**`bytesWritten`**  
  is an `integer` representing the number of bytes written
**`buffer`**  
  a reference to the buffer written, can be a
`Buffer`,
`TypedArray`, or
`DataView`



It is unsafe to use filehandle.write() multiple times
on the same file without waiting for the promise to be resolved or rejected.
**`filehandle.write(string[,
position[,
encoding]])`**  
  Writes a `string` to the file.


**`position`**  
  the offset from the beginning of the file
where the data from buffer should be written,
can be an
`integer` or
`null`,
by default is `null`.
If `position` is not a `number`,
the data will be written at the current position.
See the POSIX

| querystring.decode() |
| --- |
| querystring.encode() |
| querystring.escape() |
| querystring.parse() |
| querystring.stringify() |
| querystring.unescape() |

The Query String module provides support
for parsing and formatting URL query strings
([0.4.3](changes.xml#njs0.4.3)).
The Query String module object is imported using
`import qs from 'querystring'`.

**`querystring.decode()`**  
  is an alias for
querystring.parse().
**`querystring.encode()`**  
  is an alias for
querystring.stringify().
**`querystring.escape(string)`**  
  Performs URL encoding of the given string,
returns an escaped query string.
The method is used by
querystring.stringify()
and should not be used directly.
**`querystring.parse(string[,
separator[,
equal[,
options]]])`**  
  Parses the query string URL and returns an object.



The separator parameter is a substring
for delimiting key and value pairs in the query string,
by default is “&”.



The equal parameter is a substring
for delimiting keys and values in the query string,
by default is “=”.



The options parameter is expected to be
an object with the following keys:

decodeURIComponent
function

Function used
to decode percent-encoded characters in the query string,
by default is
querystring.unescape()


maxKeys
number

the maximum number of keys to parse,
by default is 1000.
The 0 value removes limitations for counting keys.



By default, percent-encoded characters within the query string are assumed
to use the UTF-8 encoding,
invalid UTF-8 sequences will be replaced with
the U+FFFD replacement character.



For example, for the following query string

'foo=bar&abc=xyz&abc=123'

the output will be:

{
  foo: 'bar',
  abc: ['xyz', '123']
}
**`querystring.stringify(object[,
separator[,
equal[,
options]]])`**  
  Serializes an object and returns a URL query string.



The separator parameter is a substring
for delimiting key and value pairs in the query string,
by default is “&”.



The equal parameter is a substring
for delimiting keys and values in the query string,
by default is “=”.



The options parameter is expected to be
an object with the following keys:

encodeURIComponent
function

The function to use when converting
URL-unsafe characters to percent-encoding in the query string,
by default is
querystring.escape().






By default, characters that require percent-encoding within the query string
are encoded as UTF-8.
If other encoding is required, then
encodeURIComponent option should be specified.



For example, for the following command

querystring.stringify({ foo: 'bar', baz: ['qux', 'quux'], 123: '' });

the query string will be:

'foo=bar&baz=qux&baz=quux&123='
**`querystring.unescape(string)`**  
  Performs decoding of URL percent-encoded characters
of the string,
returns an unescaped query string.
The method is used by
querystring.parse()
and should not be used directly.
