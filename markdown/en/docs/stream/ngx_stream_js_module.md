# Module ngx_stream_js_module

**Revision:** 53  
**Language:** en


The `ngx_stream_js_module` module is used to implement
handlers in [njs](../njs/index.html) —
a subset of the JavaScript language.

Download and install instructions are available
[here](../njs/install.html).

## Example Configuration {#example}

The example works since
[0.4.0](../njs/changes.xml#njs0.4.0).

```
stream {
    js_import stream.js;

    js_set $bar stream.bar;
    js_set $req_line stream.req_line;

    server {
        listen 12345;

        js_preread stream.preread;
        return     $req_line;
    }

    server {
        listen 12346;

        js_access  stream.access;
        proxy_pass 127.0.0.1:8000;
        js_filter  stream.header_inject;
    }
}

http {
    server {
        listen 8000;
        location / {
            return 200 $http_foo\n;
        }
    }
}
```

The `stream.js` file:

```
var line = '';

function bar(s) {
    var v = s.variables;
    s.log("hello from bar() handler!");
    return "bar-var" + v.remote_port + "; pid=" + v.pid;
}

function preread(s) {
    s.on('upload', function (data, flags) {
        var n = data.indexOf('\n');
        if (n != -1) {
            line = data.substr(0, n);
            s.done();
        }
    });
}

function req_line(s) {
    return line;
}

// Read HTTP request line.
// Collect bytes in 'req' until
// request line is read.
// Injects HTTP header into a client's request

var my_header =  'Foo: foo';
function header_inject(s) {
    var req = '';
    s.on('upload', function(data, flags) {
        req += data;
        var n = req.search('\n');
        if (n != -1) {
            var rest = req.substr(n + 1);
            req = req.substr(0, n + 1);
            s.send(req + my_header + '\r\n' + rest, flags);
            s.off('upload');
        }
    });
}

function access(s) {
    if (s.remoteAddress.match('^192.*')) {
        s.deny();
        return;
    }

    s.allow();
}

export default {bar, preread, req_line, header_inject, access};
```

## Directives {#directives}


module.function

stream
server


Sets an njs function which will be called at the
access phase.
Since 0.4.0,
a module function can be referenced.



The function is called once at the moment when the stream session reaches
the access phase
for the first time.
The function is called with the following arguments:


s

the Stream Session object






At this phase, it is possible to perform initialization
or register a callback with
the s.on()
method
for each incoming data chunk until one of the following methods are called:
s.allow(),
s.decline(),
s.done().
As soon as one of these methods is called, the stream session processing
switches to the next phase
and all current
s.on()
callbacks are dropped.




number
128
stream
server
0.8.6


Sets a maximum number of JS context to be reused for
QuickJS engine.
Each context is used for a single stream session.
The finished context is put into a pool of reusable contexts.
If the pool is full, the context is destroyed.




njs | qjs
njs
stream
server
0.8.6


Sets a JavaScript engine
to be used for njs scripts.
The njs parameter sets the njs engine, also used by default.
The qjs parameter sets the QuickJS engine.




size
16k
stream
server
0.7.4


Sets the size of the buffer used for reading and writing
with Fetch API.




ciphers
HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5
stream
server
0.7.0


Specifies the enabled ciphers for HTTPS connections
with Fetch API.
The ciphers are specified in the format understood by the OpenSSL library.



The full list can be viewed using the
“openssl ciphers” command.




size
1m
stream
server
0.7.4


Sets the maximum size of the response received
with Fetch API.





    [TLSv1]
    [TLSv1.1]
    [TLSv1.2]
    [TLSv1.3]
TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2
stream
server
0.7.0


Enables the specified protocols for HTTPS connections
with Fetch API.




time
60s
stream
server
0.7.4


Defines a timeout for reading and writing
for Fetch API.
The timeout is set only between two successive read/write operations,
not for the whole response.
If no data is transmitted within this time, the connection is closed.




file

stream
server
0.7.0


Specifies a file with trusted CA certificates in the PEM format
used to
verify
the HTTPS certificate
with Fetch API.




on | off
on
stream
server
0.7.4


Enables or disables verification of the HTTPS server certificate
with Fetch API.




number
100
stream
server
0.7.0


Sets the verification depth in the HTTPS server certificates chain
with Fetch API.




url

stream
server
0.9.4


Configures a forward proxy URL
with Fetch API.
The url supports the HTTP scheme only
and can contain optional user credentials
in the format http://[user:password@]host:port
for Basic authentication.
Supports both HTTP and HTTPS connections to destination servers.
If the url is empty, proxy routing is disabled.
The parameter value can contain variables.



Example:

server {
    listen 12345;
    js_fetch_proxy http://user:pass@proxy.example.com:3128;
    js_preread main.fetch_handler;
}





connections
0
stream
server
0.9.2


Activates the cache for connections to destination servers.
When the value is greater than 0,
enables keepalive connections for
Fetch API.



The connections parameter sets the maximum number of idle
keepalive connections to destination servers that are preserved in the cache
of each worker process.
When this number is exceeded, the least recently used connections are closed.



Example:

server {
    listen 12345;
    js_fetch_keepalive 32;
    js_fetch_trusted_certificate /path/to/ISRG_Root_X1.pem;
    js_preread main.fetch_handler;
}





number
1000
stream
server
0.9.2


Sets the maximum number of requests that can be served through one keepalive
connection with Fetch API.
After the maximum number of requests is made, the connection is closed.



Closing connections periodically is necessary to free per-connection memory
allocations.
Therefore, using too high maximum number of requests could result in
excessive memory usage and not recommended.




time
1h
stream
server
0.9.2


Limits the maximum time during which requests can be processed through one
keepalive connection with Fetch API.
After this time is reached, the connection is closed following the subsequent
request processing.




time
60s
stream
server
0.9.2


Sets a timeout during which an idle keepalive connection to a destination server
will stay open with Fetch API.




module.function

stream
server


Sets a data filter.
Since 0.4.0,
a module function can be referenced.
The filter function is called once at the moment when the stream session reaches
the content phase.



The filter function is called with the following arguments:

s

the Stream Session object






At this phase, it is possible to perform initialization
or register a callback with
the s.on()
method for each incoming data chunk.
The
s.off()
method may be used to unregister a callback and stop filtering.




As the js_filter handler
returns its result immediately, it supports
only synchronous operations.
Thus, asynchronous operations such as
ngx.fetch()
or
setTimeout()
are not supported.





module.js |
export_name from module.js

stream
server
0.4.0


Imports a module that implements location and variable handlers in njs.
The export_name is used as a namespace
to access module functions.
If the export_name is not specified,
the module name will be used as a namespace.

js_import stream.js;

Here, the module name stream is used as a namespace
while accessing exports.
If the imported module exports foo(),
stream.foo is used to refer to it.



Several js_import directives can be specified.




The directive can be specified on the
server level
since 0.7.7.





file

stream


Specifies a file that implements server and variable handlers in njs:

nginx.conf:
js_include stream.js;
js_set     $js_addr address;
server {
    listen 127.0.0.1:12345;
    return $js_addr;
}

stream.js:
function address(s) {
    return s.remoteAddress;
}




The directive was made obsolete in version
0.4.0
and was removed in version
0.7.1.
The  directive should be used instead.





path

stream
server
0.3.0


Sets an additional path for njs modules.




The directive can be specified on the
server level
since 0.7.7.





module.function
        [interval=time]
        [jitter=number]
        [worker_affinity=mask]

server
0.8.1


Specifies a content handler to run at regular interval.
The handler receives a
session object
as its first argument,
it also has access to global objects such as
ngx.



The optional interval parameter
sets the interval between two consecutive runs,
by default, 5 seconds.



The optional jitter parameter sets the time within which
the location content handler will be randomly delayed,
by default, there is no delay.



By default, the js_handler is executed on worker process 0.
The optional worker_affinity parameter
allows specifying particular worker processes
where the location content handler should be executed.
Each worker process set is represented by a bitmask of allowed worker processes.
The all mask allows the handler to be executed
in all worker processes.



Example:

example.conf:

location @periodics {
    # to be run at 1 minute intervals in worker process 0
    js_periodic main.handler interval=60s;

    # to be run at 1 minute intervals in all worker processes
    js_periodic main.handler interval=60s worker_affinity=all;

    # to be run at 1 minute intervals in worker processes 1 and 3
    js_periodic main.handler interval=60s worker_affinity=0101;

    resolver 10.0.0.1;
    js_fetch_trusted_certificate /path/to/ISRG_Root_X1.pem;
}

example.js:

async function handler(s) {
    let reply = await ngx.fetch('https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/');
    let body = await reply.text();

    ngx.log(ngx.INFO, body);
}





name.json |
name from file.json

stream
server
0.7.8


Preloads an
immutable object
at configure time.
The name is used as a name of the global variable
though which the object is available in njs code.
If the name is not specified,
the file name will be used instead.

js_preload_object map.json;

Here, the map is used as a name
while accessing the preloaded object.



Several js_preload_object directives can be specified.




module.function

stream
server


Sets an njs function which will be called at the
preread phase.
Since 0.4.0,
a module function can be referenced.



The function is called once
at the moment when the stream session reaches the
preread phase
for the first time.
The function is called with the following arguments:


s

the Stream Session object






At this phase, it is possible to perform initialization
or register a callback with
the s.on()
method
for each incoming data chunk until one of the following methods are called:
s.allow(),
s.decline(),
s.done().
When one of these methods is called,
the stream session switches to the
next phase
and all current
s.on()
callbacks are dropped.




As the js_preread handler
returns its result immediately, it supports
only synchronous callbacks.
Thus, asynchronous callbacks such as
ngx.fetch()
or
setTimeout()
are not supported.
Nevertheless, asynchronous operations are supported in
s.on()
callbacks in the
preread phase.
See
this example for more information.






    $variable
    module.function
    [nocache]

stream
server


Sets an njs function
for the specified variable.
Since 0.4.0,
a module function can be referenced.



The function is called when
the variable is referenced for the first time for a given request.
The exact moment depends on a
phase
at which the variable is referenced.
This can be used to perform some logic
not related to variable evaluation.
For example, if the variable is referenced only in the
 directive,
its handler will not be executed until the log phase.
This handler can be used to do some cleanup
right before the request is freed.



Since 0.8.6, when
optional argument nocache is provided the handler
is called every time it is referenced.
Due to current limitations
of the rewrite module,
when a nocache variable is referenced by the
set directive
its handler should always return a fixed-length value.




As the js_set handler
returns its result immediately, it supports
only synchronous callbacks.
Thus, asynchronous callbacks such as
ngx.fetch()
or
setTimeout()
are not supported.





The directive can be specified on the
server level
since 0.7.7.






    zone=name:size
    [timeout=time]
    [type=string|number]
    [evict]
    [state=file]

stream
0.8.0


Sets the name and size of the shared memory zone
that keeps the
key-value dictionary
shared between worker processes.



By default the shared dictionary uses a string as a key and a value.
The optional type parameter
allows redefining the value type to number.



The optional timeout parameter sets
the time in milliseconds
after which all shared dictionary entries are removed from the zone.
If some entries require a different removal time, it can be set
with the timeout argument of the
add,
incr, and
set
methods
(0.8.5).



The optional evict parameter removes the oldest
key-value pair when the zone storage is exhausted.



The optional state parameter specifies a file
that keeps the shared dictionary state
in JSON format and makes it persistent across nginx restarts
(0.9.1).



Example:

example.conf:
    # Creates a 1Mb dictionary with string values,
    # removes key-value pairs after 60 seconds of inactivity:
    js_shared_dict_zone zone=foo:1M timeout=60s;

    # Creates a 512Kb dictionary with string values,
    # forcibly removes oldest key-value pairs when the zone is exhausted:
    js_shared_dict_zone zone=bar:512K timeout=30s evict;

    # Creates a 32Kb permanent dictionary with number values:
    js_shared_dict_zone zone=num:32k type=number;

    # Creates a 1Mb dictionary with string values and persistent state:
    js_shared_dict_zone zone=persistent:1M state=/tmp/dict.json;

example.js:
    function get(r) {
        r.return(200, ngx.shared.foo.get(r.args.key));
    }

    function set(r) {
        r.return(200, ngx.shared.foo.set(r.args.key, r.args.value));
    }

    function del(r) {
        r.return(200, ngx.shared.bar.delete(r.args.key));
    }

    function increment(r) {
        r.return(200, ngx.shared.num.incr(r.args.key, 2));
    }





$variable [value]

stream
server
0.5.3


Declares
a writable
variable.
The value can contain text, variables, and their combination.




The directive can be specified on the
server level
since 0.7.7.




## Session Object Properties {#properties}

Each stream njs handler receives one argument, a stream session
[object](../njs/reference.xml#stream).
