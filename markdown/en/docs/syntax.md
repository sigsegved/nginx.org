# Configuration file measurement units

**Revision:** 4

nginx supports several measurement units for specifying sizes, offsets, and time intervals within configuration files.

# Sizes and offsets {#size}

Sizes can be specified in bytes, kilobytes, or megabytes using the following suffixes:

- `k` and `K` for kilobytes
- `m` and `M` for megabytes

For example, “ `1024` ”, “ `8k` ”, “ `1m` ”.

Offsets can be also specified in gigabytes using the `g` or `G` suffixes.

# Time intervals {#time}

Time intervals can be specified in milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours, days and so on, using the following suffixes: 

Multiple units can be combined in a single value by specifying them in the order from the most to the least significant, and optionally separated by whitespace. For example, “ `1h 30m` ” specifies the same time as “ `90m` ” or “ `5400s` ”.

  A value without a suffix means seconds.

  It is recommended to always specify a suffix.

  Certain time intervals can be specified only with a seconds resolution.
